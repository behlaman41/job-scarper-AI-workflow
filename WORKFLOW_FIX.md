# 🔧 Workflow Fix Instructions

## ✅ Issues Resolved

1. **Missing Dependencies**: Installed `axios` and `moment-timezone` in n8n container
2. **Wrong Service URL**: Updated workflow to use `http://host.docker.internal:3000`
3. **Services Running**: Both n8n and scraper services are operational

## 📥 Re-import Updated Workflow

Since you already imported the workflow, you need to update it with the fixes:

### Option 1: Update Existing Workflow (Recommended)

1. **In n8n interface** (http://localhost:5678):
   - Open your existing "Daily Job Scraper Workflow"
   - Click on the "Execute Workflow" node (the one with code)
   - In the Function code editor, find this line:
     ```javascript
     const SCRAPER_API_URL = 'http://playwright-scraper:3000';
     ```
   - Change it to:
     ```javascript
     const SCRAPER_API_URL = 'http://host.docker.internal:3000';
     ```
   - Click "Save" or "Update"

### Option 2: Re-import Fresh Workflow

1. **Delete existing workflow** in n8n
2. **Import again** from `workflows/daily-job-scraper.json`
3. **Save and activate**

## 🧪 Test the Workflow

1. **Click "Execute workflow"** button
2. **Monitor execution** - you should see:
   - ✅ Daily Trigger (green)
   - ✅ Execute Workflow (green)
   - ✅ Check Success (green)
   - ✅ Success Handler (green)

## 🎯 Expected Results

The workflow should now:
- ✅ Connect to scraper service successfully
- ✅ Run health check
- ✅ Execute job scraping
- ✅ Complete without "Cannot find module 'axios'" error

## 🔍 If Still Having Issues

Check the execution logs in n8n:
1. Click on any node that failed
2. Look at the "Output" or "Error" tab
3. The logs will show detailed error information

**The workflow should now work perfectly! Try executing it again.** 🚀
